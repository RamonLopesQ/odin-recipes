This is the first project from theodinproject.com. It consists on a simple index page, with a list of links to the recipes (only 3, since this one is pretty simple), which contains a description, image, ingredients needed, and a step guide. All of the content is made using only HTML statments and attributes.

Ps: The original recipes can be found in https://www.allrecipes.com (I just used them as an example to make the project)
